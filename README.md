- **The Object model** is the class that is a blueprint of the flower (**documentId**, **externalId**, **name**, **description**, **imageUrl**).
- **Services** authenticating the user (in this case with google account) and reading data from ** The Firebase** database and maps it into a list.
- **The Firebase database** stores **collection of documents** with containing information about flowers (**keys/values**).
